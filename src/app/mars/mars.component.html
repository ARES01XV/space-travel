            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun â€“ a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin
            atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons,
            extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. <br><br>
            Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only
            planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA currently has
            two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter
            (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars. <br><br>
            One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the
            Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days. Mars is a rocky planet. Its solid surface
            has been altered by volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical
            reactions.
